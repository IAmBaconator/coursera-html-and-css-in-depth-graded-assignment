# Project Overview
This project was created for the Lucky Shrub brand as part of _Coursera’s HTML and CSS in Depth_ course within the Meta Front-End Developer program. It serves as a portfolio reference demonstrating my understanding of semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and foundational front-end layout techniques.
# Purpose
The goal of this project is to showcase front-end fundamentals through a structured, accessible, and responsive webpage. This repository is intended both as a portfolio artifact for recruiters and as a long-term personal code reference.
# Skills Demonstrated
* Semantic HTML5
* CSS layout (Flexbox / Grid if applicable)
* Responsive design principles
* Accessibility-conscious structure
* Clean, readable code organization
# Notes
This project reflects my learning progress at the time of completion and represents my approach to writing maintainable, standards-based front-end code.
